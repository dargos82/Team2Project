RSA encryption's robustness hinges on the computational infeasibility of factoring large prime numbers. To validate its security, rigorous mathematical proofs underpin the algorithm's correctness. Furthermore, extensive cryptanalysis and peer review have subjected RSA to scrutiny, with no practical attacks discovered to date. 
However, proper key generation, management, and usage are paramount. Weak key lengths or implementation flaws can compromise security. Hence, staying updated with cryptographic best practices and employing robust key management systems is essential for maintaining RSA's effectiveness in modern cryptographic landscapes.
